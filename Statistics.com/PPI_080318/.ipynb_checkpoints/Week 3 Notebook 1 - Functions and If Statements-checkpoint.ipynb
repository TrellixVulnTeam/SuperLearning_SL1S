    "Functions are blocks of code designed to make life easier for both the programmer and the user.  If we have an often used code routine, rather than copying and pasting the same code in several places, we would write the code once and call it when we need it.  Python has a large set of built-in functions (such as list.sort() and sum(list_of_numbers)) and you can add thousands of extra functions by using add-on packages, but it is also important to be able to write your own functions... and we'll do that shortly.\n",

    "\n",
    "We must use the def keyword to begin a function.  We also give the function a name (hopefully descriptive) and the number of arguments or values we intend to pass to the function.  Many simple functions take only one argument, but we can pass multiple values (and even lists) if needed. We then provide a procedure to work with or on the supplied arguments.  Once the function has been defined by the Python interpreter, we can call it from anywhere in the program as many times as we wish... even later on in the Jupyter notebook!"
