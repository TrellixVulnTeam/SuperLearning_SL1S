    "# While Loops, Data Input and Basic Error Trapping\n",
    "As you might guess, while loops are another form of looping.  While (no pun intended) for loops have a definite beginning and end based on the parameters in the range() statement, while loops are based on conditionals much like if statements.  As long as a specific condition is True, the while loop will continue looping.  When the condition becomes False, the while loop ends.  Here is a template for while loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# specify and set the initial condition to True\n",
    "running = True\n",
    "\n",
    "# here is the while loop\n",
    "while running:\n",
    "    # do some stuff here\n",
    "    # and do some stuff here if needed\n",
    "    # at some point you would need\n",
    "    # to set running = False\n",
    "    # otherwise the loop will never end\n",
    "    \n",
    "# once the loop ends, the program continues here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* The while loop needs to start with a True condition\n",
    "* The while statement itself contains the condition test\n",
    "* As long as the condition remains True, the loop continues\n",
    "* As soon as the condition changes to False, the loop ends\n",
    "* Once the loop ends, the program continues with the lines after the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "One common error is to create a loop where the condition NEVER becomes False.  In that event, the loop continues.  We call this an infinite loop... or as my math professor friend calls it (and my favorite expression), an eternal loop.  You can usually break out of eternal loops by using Ctrl-C or clicking on a Stop button in Jupyter (the black square in the icon menu) or Cancel Build in Sublime Text or something similar."

You can count by any value, even non-integers if you wish.  This method is not limited to addition and subtraction.  You can also use \\* and / if you wish by using count \\*= (for example) or count /= 2.\n",

You read this statement from right to left.  The value of the right side is assigned to the left side variable.  Which count version is best?  I think the += symbol is a bit more efficient, but it's your choice."
